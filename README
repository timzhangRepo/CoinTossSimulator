CERTIFY IT'S YOUR WORK

"I certify that the work submitted for this assignment does not
violate USC's student conduct code.  In particular, the work is my
own, not a collaboration, and does not involve code created by other
people, except for the the resources explicitly mentioned in the CS 455
Course Syllabus.  And I did not share my solution or parts of it with
other students in the course."

ACKNOWLEDGE ANY OUTSIDE SOURCES

List here any code you submitted for this assignment that was written
with significant help of a course staff member, or code used from the
textbook.  Be specific about what methods or algorithms are involved,
and what sections of the textbook are involved (if applicable): [you do
not need to list any of the code that we wrote for the assignment,
i.e., the contents of the starter files for the assignment]


Code snippet from the assignment 1 description page and that's it.

ANSWERS TO ASSIGNMENT README QUESTIONS (if applicable):
QUESTIONS:
1.In CS 455 what code from the web are you allowed to use in your
assignment solution, assuming you modify that code once you get it?
(No clue? Hint: Reread the syllabus.)
Note: no need to mention the "starter files" for the assignment in your answer.

ANSWER: Using code from a solution or adapted solution to an assignment found on the web
is not allowed by the code of conduct;

2.What is the probability of each of the three outcomes in a trial: two heads,
one head and one tail, and two tails? Why is one of them different than the other two?

ANSWER: the probablity of each of the three outcomes are 25%, 50%, and 25%. There are
four combinations for the outcomes: HH,TH,HT,TT; the TH and HT are the same thus resulting
one head and one tail to become 50%.

3.Roughly how many trials do you need to do before you mostly get results
within 1% of these probabilities? Do several simulations using your program to determine an answer to this.

ANSWER: Roughly 1000 trails;

4.Roughly how many trials can you do before it crashes with an overflow error?
State the largest value you tried where it still worked correctly, and one where it overflowed.
You can get an idea of what general values to try by looking at the limits on Java integers
(see Section 4.1.1 of the text). Play around with your program to verify that it actually
works for very large values that are within the limits. Note: this kind of testing can
sometimes turn up bugs, so it's good to do. Warning: For very large values you may have to
wait a fair amount of time before you get the results.

ANSWER: 7000, which is the max recursive call limit in Java. Please refer CoinTossSimulator.java:81, where
recursive method was used to simulate coin toss.
